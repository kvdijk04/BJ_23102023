                            Janine and husband Jeff developed a retail concept different to anything the world had seen before. Founded on Janine's 'love life' philosophy, Boost Juice would offer a unique customer experience around happy, healthy living and delicious products.

                            Operating from her kitchen table in Melbourne, Janine consulted nutritionists and naturopaths to create a menu free from preservatives and artificial colours and flavourings.

                            Just one problem: the banks wouldn’t touch a business that just sold liquid. But as they say, when life hands you lemons, make lemonade. Or juices and smoothies, as the case may be.

                            They say success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. And who’s going to argue with that? Little did Janine know that her plan to not work a 40-hour week would actually mean working a 100-hour week, with no money coming in for a good three years.

                            But hard work is often rewarded, and the success of the first King William St store allowed Janine and Jeff to open three new sites – including two in one day.

                            Faced with the juice shop job and not being able to sell juice, the team had to rush to Australian retail department store Myer to buy domestic juicers. All were damaged after just a day of use, but before the new equipment was brought in, the job was finally completed. These barriers are for us to overcome.

                            Sometimes, the best way to learn is to jump in at the deep end, and that’s exactly what happened next. Janine and Jeff signed on for 28 leases at Westfield Shopping Centres. It meant a personal liability of over $5 million and a deadline to open every store in just 18 months. Thanks to sheer determination and amazing franchise partners, it happened on time and on budget.
